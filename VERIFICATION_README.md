# Verification Scripts for Bcrypt Fix and Email Validation

This directory contains scripts to verify that the bcrypt password length fix and email-based file validation are working correctly.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `verify_local.py` - Local Testing
**Purpose**: Test password hashing functions locally without requiring the full application setup.

**What it tests**:
- Password hashing with various lengths (5-200 characters)
- Password verification with correct and incorrect passwords
- Bcrypt-specific functionality and limitations
- Argon2 functionality for long passwords
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

**Usage**:
```bash
python verify_local.py
```

**Requirements**:
- Python environment with the app dependencies installed
- Access to the `pdf_saas_app` directory

### 2. `verify_api.py` - API Testing
**Purpose**: Test the deployed application's API endpoints to verify the fixes work in production.

**What it tests**:
- Application health endpoint
- API documentation accessibility
- Authentication with various password lengths
- Protected endpoint access
- Document-related endpoints

**Usage**:
```bash
python verify_api.py
```

**Requirements**:
- Internet connection
- Deployed application running on Render
- Valid user credentials in the database

### 3. `verify_fixes.py` - Comprehensive Testing
**Purpose**: Complete verification script that tests both local functions and remote API.

**What it tests**:
- All local password hashing tests
- Database connection and email-based validation
- All API endpoint tests
- End-to-end functionality

**Usage**:
```bash
python verify_fixes.py
```

**Requirements**:
- Full application setup
- Database connection
- Internet connection for API tests

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Successful Test Output

#### Local Password Tests:
```
üß™ Testing Password Functions Locally...
==================================================

Test 1: Password length 5 chars (expected: 5)
  Password: short
  Hash: $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$...
  Verification: ‚úÖ PASS
  Wrong password test: ‚úÖ PASS

Test 2: Password length 50 chars (expected: 50)
  Password: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
  Hash: $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$...
  Verification: ‚úÖ PASS
  Wrong password test: ‚úÖ PASS

Test 3: Password length 100 chars (expected: 100)
  Password: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
  Hash: $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$...
  Verification: ‚úÖ PASS
  Wrong password test: ‚úÖ PASS
```

#### API Tests:
```
üåê Testing API Authentication...
==================================================

  Test 1: Short password (5 chars)
    ‚úÖ Login successful - Token received
    ‚úÖ Protected endpoint access - User: davidokoh@gmail.com

  Test 2: Medium password (50 chars)
    ‚úÖ Login successful - Token received
    ‚úÖ Protected endpoint access - User: davidokoh@gmail.com

  Test 3: Long password (100 chars)
    ‚úÖ Login successful - Token received
    ‚úÖ Protected endpoint access - User: davidokoh@gmail.com
```

### ‚ùå Failed Test Indicators

#### Bcrypt Errors (Should NOT appear):
```
ValueError: password cannot be longer than 72 bytes, truncate manually if necessary
```

#### Authentication Failures:
```
‚ùå Login failed: 500 - Internal Server Error
‚ùå Protected endpoint failed: 401
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. Import Errors
```
ImportError: No module named 'pdf_saas_app'
```
**Solution**: Run from the project root directory, not from a subdirectory.

#### 2. Database Connection Errors
```
psycopg2.OperationalError: could not connect to server
```
**Solution**: Check that `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set correctly.

#### 3. API Connection Errors
```
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool
```
**Solution**: Check that the application is deployed and running on Render.

#### 4. Authentication Failures
```
‚ùå Login failed: 401 - Unauthorized
```
**Solution**: Verify that test user credentials exist in the database.

## What the Fixes Address

### 1. Bcrypt Password Length Issue
- **Problem**: Bcrypt has a 72-byte password limit
- **Solution**: Truncate passwords to 72 bytes before hashing/verification
- **Verification**: Test with passwords longer than 72 characters

### 2. Email-Based File Validation
- **Problem**: File access was tied to user IDs, making it fragile
- **Solution**: Use email-based validation for file access
- **Verification**: Test document access with email-based queries

### 3. Error Handling
- **Problem**: Poor error handling caused authentication failures
- **Solution**: Robust error handling with fallback mechanisms
- **Verification**: Test with various edge cases and error conditions

## Running the Scripts

### Quick Local Test:
```bash
python verify_local.py
```

### Full API Test:
```bash
python verify_api.py
```

### Complete Verification:
```bash
python verify_fixes.py
```

## Success Criteria

All verification scripts should show:
- ‚úÖ All password length tests pass
- ‚úÖ No bcrypt errors in logs
- ‚úÖ Authentication works for all password lengths
- ‚úÖ API endpoints respond correctly
- ‚úÖ Database queries work with email-based validation

If any tests fail, check the error messages and refer to the troubleshooting section above.
